{"documents":[{"title":"BMD Slate","typeoverride":null,"nopostershadow":null,"description":"BMD Slate is an application designed to remotely control cameras designed by Blackmagic Design with an attractive and functional UI. It is still in development, but will eventually run on iOS, Android, Windows 10, and macOS. I wrote this app in order to change the camera's digital slate from a phone or tablet: The 2nd AC is then able to view and edit the slate without physical access to the camera, and the editor gets the scene, take, etc.. straight into the footage metadata. \n\n**Current features:**\n- Connect to a Blackmagic Design camera, and display information such as time remaining, storage media status, battery voltage, etc..\n- Change the camera's digital slate (including granular control over the scene number, to increment from \"6A\" to \"6B\", etc... from the tap of a button)\n- Marking the last recorded clip as a \"good take\"\n\n**Upcoming features**\n- Connecting to multiple cameras","contentblocks":[],"moreinfo":[],"date":"2020-04-08","id":"7","slug":"bmdslate","backgroundcolor":"#1e1f23","foregroundcolor":"#3097fd","foregroundcolor2":"#94959d","images":[{"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_bmdslate.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_bmdslate_581dfc286f","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":245,"height":138,"size":3.46,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_bmdslate_581dfc286f.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_bmdslate.jpg","hash":"large_bmdslate_581dfc286f","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":563,"size":30.51,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/large_bmdslate_581dfc286f.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_bmdslate.jpg","hash":"medium_bmdslate_581dfc286f","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":422,"size":18.23,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_bmdslate_581dfc286f.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_bmdslate.jpg","hash":"small_bmdslate_581dfc286f","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":281,"size":9.56,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_bmdslate_581dfc286f.jpg"}},"url":"/uploads/bmdslate_581dfc286f.jpg"}],"poster":{"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_bmd.png","hash":"thumbnail_bmd_c1be960d1f","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":156,"height":156,"size":8.45,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_bmd_c1be960d1f.png"},"small":{"name":"small_bmd.png","hash":"small_bmd_c1be960d1f","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":500,"size":42.33,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_bmd_c1be960d1f.png"}},"width":512,"height":512},"tags":[{"id":"5","name":"C#","icon":"<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Layer_2_1_\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" \t viewBox=\"0 0 14 12.5\" style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 14 12.5;\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <g> \t<path d=\"M7.2,1L7.2,1l4.5,2.6l0,0v5.2l-4.5,2.6l0,0L2.6,8.9l0,0V3.6l0,0L7.2,1L7.2,1 M7.2,0C7,0,6.8,0,6.7,0.1L2.1,2.8 \t\tC1.8,2.9,1.6,3.3,1.6,3.6v5.3c0,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.5,0.8l4.6,2.6c0.1,0.1,0.3,0.1,0.5,0.1s0.3,0,0.5-0.1l4.6-2.6 \t\tc0.3-0.2,0.5-0.5,0.5-0.8V3.6c0-0.3-0.2-0.6-0.5-0.8L7.7,0.1C7.5,0,7.3,0,7.2,0L7.2,0z\"/> </g> <path d=\"M8.5,7.5C7.4,8.6,5.4,7.8,5.4,6.2c0-1.7,2-2.4,3.1-1.3l1.3-1.3C7.5,1.3,3.5,2.9,3.5,6.2C3.6,9.7,7.6,11,9.8,8.8L8.5,7.5z\"/> <path d=\"M11.283,5.648V5.124h-0.378l0.067-0.797H10.45l-0.067,0.797H9.875l0.067-0.797H9.42L9.352,5.124H8.818v0.524h0.49 \tL9.241,6.436H8.818V6.96h0.379L9.13,7.758h0.523L9.72,6.96h0.507L10.16,7.758h0.522l0.067-0.797h0.534V6.436h-0.489l0.067-0.788 \tH11.283z M10.271,6.436H9.764l0.067-0.788h0.507L10.271,6.436z\"/> </svg>"},{"id":"9","name":"Xamarin","icon":"<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Layer_2_1_\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" \t viewBox=\"0 0 14 12.5\" style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 14 12.5;\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path d=\"M10,1C10,1,10,1,10,1l3,5.2c0,0,0,0.1,0,0.1l-3,5.1c0,0-0.1,0-0.1,0H4c0,0-0.1,0-0.1,0L1,6.3c0,0,0-0.1,0-0.1l3-5.1 \tC4,1,4,1,4,1H10 M10,0H4C3.7,0,3.3,0.2,3.1,0.6l-3,5.1C0,6,0,6.5,0.1,6.8l3,5.1c0.2,0.3,0.6,0.5,0.9,0.5H10c0.4,0,0.7-0.2,0.9-0.5 \tl3-5.1C14,6.5,14,6,13.9,5.7l-3-5.1C10.7,0.2,10.3,0,10,0L10,0z\"/> <path d=\"M5.7,6.3L4,9.3c0,0.1,0,0.2,0.1,0.2h1c0,0,0.1,0,0.1-0.1L7,6.4c0,0,0,0,0,0c0,0,0,0,0,0l1.7,3.1c0,0,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1h1 \tC10,9.5,10,9.4,10,9.3l-1.7-3l1.7-3c0-0.1,0-0.2-0.1-0.2h-1c0,0-0.1,0-0.1,0.1L7,6.2c0,0,0,0,0,0c0,0,0,0,0,0L5.3,3.1 \tc0,0-0.1-0.1-0.1-0.1h-1c0,0,0,0,0,0C4,3.1,4,3.2,4,3.3L5.7,6.3z\"/> </svg>"}]}]}
