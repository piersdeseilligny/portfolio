Established programs like Final Draft or Fade In can seem clunky and dated, while new online ones (such as Celtx) often have poor formatting support and can go offline from one day to the next (like Amazon storywriter did).\nI then discovered the fountain syntax, and [the incredible advantages it has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lElhyw3WGxo). However the only decent fountain editor at the time was Highland 2, only available on macOS. I therefore decided to write an extension to add Fountain support to vscode, a powerful text editor.
